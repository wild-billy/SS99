 String Processing
----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Common operations
   - Sanitization
   - Getting, finding, inserting
   - Splitting and merging
   - Mapping, transforms
   - Encoding (between HTML, ascii, utf-8, etc)
 
 * .ini (semi-custom format) reading and writing
 * .cfg (custom format) reading and writing
 * .yaml (YAML format) reading and writing
 
 * Regex engine? May be useful in the future (.dll not softcode)
   Carn may have a working one.
 
 * Should probably define a text styling format at some point to
   reduce the hideous and terrible HTML universal in SS13 code.
   Suggested names: fuarkdown, quarkdown

 Mathematics
----------------------------------------------------------------
 * TimSort (port implementation by Carn)
 * Bresenham (line-drawing, needs to be in pixel positions)
 * Pathfinding (A* at least, BYOND's is shitty)
 * Vector calcs (we will need these for force and motion)
 * Physics helpers (yes we will have a crude physics engine)
 * Gas calculations (might as well get started now)
 * Structural smoothing algorithms (mapped-512-state?)
 * Cryptography (SHA hashes, etc, all sorts of shit)
 * Seeded CSPRNG: probably 1-3 XORshifts on top of a simple one
