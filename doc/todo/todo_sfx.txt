 OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------------------------------
 We're inevitable going to starve for good audio. Even though 
 audio artists benefit from copyright laws much more permissive
 than those for source code (eg fair use, cover version), very
 few of them release under free licenses like ours (MIT).
 
 Since we're committed to releasing this under purely MIT or
 equivalent, we can't use any restrictively-licensed audio (such
 as that under any of the Creative Commons licenses other than
 CC0). So we need to try to cook up our own or recruit mixers.
 
 non-free licenses (like CC-BY-SA, for example) and we are MIT
   so we can't use it.

 NEEDS
----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Waiting screen music
 * Soft ping sound effects for button presses
 * Ambience - general
 * Chiptunes for demo "soundtrack"
 
 * And a shit-ton more. We'll need everthing we can get in MIT.
