 Pretty Docs
----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Need a nice pretty-printed version so people actually want
   to read and write this shit.
  
 * Probably going to be HTML since LaTex is ancient and nowadays
   everyone has a browser that supports headings, links, tables,
   and colorful textboxes: all we need for documentation.
 * GitHub's doc site might be able to help with this. Maybe a 
   markdown-to-HTML generator?
 * This will require some sort of dedicated syntax highlighting
   module so we don't have to do it by hand. Probably ez-pz for
   anyone who actually knows javascript.
