 Map Tools
----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Need to port Nexis's tools to make them more portable and
   dependent on fewer external libraries (scripts are meant to
   be conveniences and having to get python and two dozen extra
   pieces of software is not very convenient).
   - DM Parser/Lexer
   - Map integrity checker
   - Map ref fixer
   - Map render generator
 
 * Cleaner tools (these reorganize .dmm's to please VCS's)

 Dreammaker is a windows 95-era piece of shit. Even a fork of
 notepad2 or SciTe would work for this. A fully portable one
 would be even better. Basically something to point new coders
 to and say "use this".
