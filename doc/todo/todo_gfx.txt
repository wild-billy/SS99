 SPRITES
----------------------------------------------------------------
 Will need a shit-ton, but this is not as bad as audio.
 Also, due to pixel position the size is not as critical as with
 SS13's tile-based system.
 
 Main needs so far:

  * Font sets in various sizes (for procedural graphics work)
    - I have a 3x5 set implemented for ascii-128-plus --wb
    - Monospace medium (about twice as large as 3x5)
    - Monospace large (about twice as large as medium)
    - Serif medium (about twice as large as 3x5)
    - Serif large (about twice as large as medium)
   
  * 48x48 wall sprites (for top-down-tilted projection ~30 dgr)
  * 48x32 floor sprites (see above)
  * 48x24,24x48 half-wall sprites

 LICENSING
----------------------------------------------------------------
 Because existing SS13 codebases haven't given a single fuck
 about properly licensing, using, and crediting the artists for
 their sprite assets (even the ones that enforce copyright for
 large and wealthy corporations: we're looking at you TG), we 
 have to track down all the spriters we can and ask permission
 to use their work in this project, under this license (MIT).
 
 Artists that have granted permission so far:
  * Nienhaus
