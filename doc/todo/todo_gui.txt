 Windows

 * Need to sort out resizing. Most recent BYOND version (507)
   fixed a related bug. BYOND devs still haven't figured out
   how to implement nearest-neighbor, which sucks donkey balls.
   Will probably have to force size at a bit over SVGA or so.
 
 * Figure out window transparency and animations. We will need 
   some to prevent having everything look like total ass, and 
   it's much easier if we can show/hide the windows themselves 
   and not just the screens we've implented on top.

 Interface
----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Need to figure out what windows we'll need. For example:
   - Main map window (a given) - size?
   - Full-screen cover (for main menu, title, and console)
   - Console input/output (see how to play nice with defaults)
   - Browser - how complex? Tabs? Full internet access?
   - Hotbar(s) - how many and how large?
   - Eye and mind extras? - for flavor and coolness
   - Inventory(s) - needed? how large? what format (tetris?)
   - Input/outputs: Where and how large? on-screen? multiple?
 
 * Need to set rough sizes to continue certain GUI code
