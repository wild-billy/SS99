 GRAPHICS
----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Need to sort out resizing. Most recent BYOND version (507)
   fixed a related bug. BYOND devs still haven't figured out
   how to implement nearest-neighbor, which sucks donkey balls.
   Will probably have to force size at a bit over SVGA or so.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 AUDIO
----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Huge need for audio -- most audio out there is released under
   non-free licenses (like CC-BY-SA, for example) and we are MIT
   so we can't use it.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 DOCUMENTATION
----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Need a pretty HTML version so people actually read it.
   GitHub's doc site might be able to help with this.
 * Lots more needed in the BYOND and DM docs (t-thanks byond)
 * New interface code needs documentation

 Interface
----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Need to figure out what windows we'll end up needing.
 * Need to set a rough size for main map control.
